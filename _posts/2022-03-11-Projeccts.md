# Current Projects
 I am currently working on a bunch of personal projects. If you have interest in collaborating on some of these please reachout via Discord or LinkedIn
 
 Embeded Linux SoC for Marvell Cavium Octeon MIPS 64bit processors
 Currently there is a BSD port that is available specifically for MIPS but I'd like to build a Linux kernel from scratch with someone
 
 PowerShell script that uses obfuscated commands to download a script and run, then upload exfiltrated data from a network using native Windows tools.
 
Pi-Hole embeded in a router (not an RaspPi router but a standard OTS router)

Pi Pico Crypto Currency Miner
